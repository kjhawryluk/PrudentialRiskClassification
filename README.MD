This project was part of an assignment for my Machine Learning class. In it, I compare the predicitive outcomes of decision trees against logisitic regression for classifying life insurrance risk. 

The dataset for this assignment came from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment
