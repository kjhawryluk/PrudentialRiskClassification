##Prudential Risk Classifier

This project was part of an assignment for my Machine Learning class. In it, I use Python with SciKit Learn, NumPy, and Pandas to compare the predicative outcomes of decision trees against logistic regression for classifying life insurance risk. 

The dataset for this assignment came from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment
